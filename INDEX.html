    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes disturbances in thinking, behavior, 
        energy or emotion that make it difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life. Research is starting 
        to uncover the complicated causes of these diseases which can include genetics, brain chemistry, 
        brain structure, experiencing trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.</p>

            <h2>What Can You Do To Help</h2>
            <P style="font-size: large;"><b>-> Showing individuals respect and acceptance</b> removes a significant barrier to successfully coping 
                with their illness. Having people see you as an individual and not as your illness can make the 
                biggest difference for someone who is struggling with their mental health.</P>
                <p style="font-size: large;"><b>-> Advocating within our circles of influence </b>helps ensure these 
                    individuals have the same rights and opportunities as other members of your church, school 
                    and community.</p>
                <p style="font-size: large;"><b>-> Learning more about mental health</b> allows us to provide helpful 
                    support to those affected in our families and communities.</p>
